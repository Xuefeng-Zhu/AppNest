# Serverpod 4.0.0 feature → product map

| Feature | AppNest use | Evidence / limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generated typed endpoints/models | Apps, builder, records/actions, invitations, streams, inbox | Generated from .spy.yaml and endpoint source; actual RPC demo |
| Auth modules / JWT / email IDP | Real account sign-in and session identity | Seeded credentials work in browser and independent clients; production mail not verified |
| Embedded PostgreSQL / migrations | Persistent local platform tables | Serialization spike, native FK migrations, restart test; no Docker substitute |
| Transactions / row locks | Receipts, grants, publication, capacity | 20 independent claim sessions, rollback and revision tests |
| Dynamic JSONB | Validated flexible record payload | ORM round-trip spike; typed projection query adapter avoids raw-envelope assumptions |
| Serverpod streams | Small authenticated revision invalidations | Revocation regression and browser refresh; uses DB polling, not private broadcasts |
| Future Calls | Wake reminder execution by run ID | Live scheduled demo with clients closed |
| Recurring Future Calls | Outbox/job/run reconciliation | Two-process interruption recovery and service logs |
| Integration-test tools | Generated endpoint harness and sessions | Real PostgreSQL tests; concurrency tests disable rollback wrapper |
| Structured logging / Insights | Request IDs, job/run/action diagnostics | Local logs; hosted Insights and operational dashboards not verified |
| Redis/shared messages | Not required for current monolith | Deferred cross-instance configuration/testing |
| Cloud storage | Not implemented in product | No file endpoints or attachment creation UI |
